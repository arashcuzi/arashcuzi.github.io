    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p className="lato light">Hey everyone! I'm a Cali born, transplant to the Midwest. I have been into technology since I was a child and had my first computer, a Commodore 64. I have done many odd jobs &mdash; like being a mechanic, washing dishes, and serving in the military &mdash; before getting into Software Engineering, Infrastructure, Cloud and DevOps.
    </p>
    <p className="lato light">I am pretty well versed in many technology stacks and modern development practices. I am an avid proponent of Test Driven Development and strive to build a quality-first DevOps mindset with all the teams I work with.</p>
    <p className="lato light">Over the past few years I have been paving the way for a transformation of how Engineers write, test, and deploy their code at Northwestern Mutual and couldn't be happier for the experiences.</p>
